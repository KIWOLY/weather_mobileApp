# 🌤️ Weather App

A beautiful **Flutter weather application** that fetches current weather information for your city. The app automatically detects your location and displays the temperature, weather condition, and an icon, with a **dynamic background** reflecting the current weather.

---

## Features

- 🌍 Automatically detects the **user's city** using GPS.
- 🌡️ Shows **current temperature** in Celsius.
- ☁️ Displays **weather conditions** (Clear, Clouds, Rain, Snow, etc.).
- 🎨 Dynamic **background gradient** based on weather.
- 🔄 **Refresh button** to update weather data.
- ✅ Handles **location permissions** gracefully.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Android Studio or VS Code
- A **WeatherAPI.com API key** (free tier works)
- Android or iOS device/emulator

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KIWOLY/weather_mobileApp.git
cd weather_app
````

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. **Add your API key** in `WeatherServices`:

```dart
final _weatherService = WeatherServices('YOUR_API_KEY_HERE');
```

4. **Run the app**:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Permissions

To detect location, the app requires the following permissions:

**Android** – `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```

---

## Dependencies

* [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) – API requests
* [geolocator](https://pub.dev/packages/geolocator) – GPS location
* [geocoding](https://pub.dev/packages/geocoding) – Convert coordinates to city
* Flutter's `material.dart` – UI components

---

## API

* **Weather API**: [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/)
* **Endpoint**: `/v1/current.json`
* **Query options**: City name (e.g., `Dodoma,TZ`) or latitude/longitude
* **Free tier**: Enough for development/testing

> ⚠️ Note: For small cities, include the country code (`TZ` for Tanzania) to avoid errors. Using **lat/lon** is more reliable.

---

## How It Works

1. Get current location using **Geolocator**.
2. Convert coordinates to city name using **Geocoding**.
3. Fetch current weather from **WeatherAPI.com** using the city name or coordinates.
4. Display temperature, weather icon, and condition.
5. Apply background gradient according to weather condition.
